In this task, you will implement a logout function to respond to the DELETE /sessions route.

The request is expected to contain the session ID as a cookie with key "session_id".

Find the user with the requested session ID. If the user exists destroy the session and redirect the user to GET /. If the user does not exist, respond with a 403 HTTP status.
